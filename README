Tie-Scalar-Timestamp version 0.01
=================================

This is a VERY simple class that creates readonly scalars that
always return the current timestamp. By default, it uses the format
'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss' (or, in strftime notation, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
and local time. You can optionally pass a hashref of options to the
call to tie to specify a pattern and whether to use UTC time instead
of local time.

A variables tied to this class is readonly, and attempting to assign to it will
raise an exception.
